The Pizza Hamburger Website

This project is a user-focused pizza and hamburger ordering platform designed using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript in accordance with modern web standards. HTML5 provides a semantic and accessible page structure, while CSS is used to create a responsive and visually appealing interface. JavaScript adds dynamic functionality, enabling an interactive user experience with real-time actions such as adding items to the cart and managing the order flow.
